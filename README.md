### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Project title: Inauguration Clustering and Key Words Extraction

+ This project is conducted by Long Xue

+ Project summary: The project consists of two parts. First one is the main part, including speeches clustering based on Tf-Idf weighted speech vector and spherical K-means, trying to discover the similarity between different inaugural speeches. This is based on R Shinny and has to be run in R studio to allow an interaction for users to find the presidents they are interested in easily. A analysis for topic changing in time sequence is also included in this part.Second part are focus on the subtraction of key words from the speeches, which I selected D.J Trump's to run the text ranking.
